    "        \"title\": \"Single vaccine could protect against all coughs, colds and flus, researchers say\",\n",
    "        \"text\": \"\"\"A single nasal spray vaccine could protect against all coughs, colds and flus, as well as bacterial lung infections, and may even ease allergies, say US researchers. The team at Stanford University have tested their \"universal vaccine\" in animals and still need to do human clinical trials. Their approach marks a \"radical departure\" from the way vaccines have been designed for more than 200 years, they say. Experts in the field said the study was \"really exciting\" despite being at an early stage and could be a \"major step forward\". Current vaccines train the body to fight one single infection. A measles vaccine protects against only measles and a chickenpox vaccine protects against only chickenpox. This is how immunisation has worked since Edward Jenner pioneered vaccines in the late 18th Century. The approach described in the journal Science does not train the immune system. Instead it mimics the way immune cells communicate with each other. It is given as a nasal spray and leaves white blood cells in our lungs – called macrophages – on \"amber alert\" and ready to jump into action no matter what infection tries to get in. The effect lasted for around three months in animal experiments. The researchers showed this heightened state of readiness led to a 100-to-1,000-fold reduction in viruses getting through the lungs and into the body. And for those that did sneak through, the rest of the immune system was \"poised, ready to fend off these in warp speed time\" said Prof Bali Pulendran, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford. The team showed the vaccine also protects against two species of bacteria - Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Pulendran told the BBC: \"This vaccine, what we term a universal vaccine, elicits a far broader response that is protective against not just the flu virus, not just the Covid virus, not just the common cold virus, but against virtually all viruses, and as many different bacteria as we've tested, and even allergens. \"The principle by which this vaccine works is a radical departure from the principle by which all vaccines have worked so far.\" The way it steers the immune system towards fighting an infection also seemed to reduce the response to house dust mite allergens – which are a trigger of allergic asthma. \"This is a really exciting piece of research,\" says Prof Daniela Ferreira, a professor of vaccinology at University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study. She said it could \"change how we protect people from common coughs, colds and other respiratory infections\" if the results are confirmed in human studies. \"One of the strengths\" of the study was a clear explanation of how this new style of vaccine was working, she added. Ferreira said the research \"could mark a major step forward\" offering protection against infections that \"place such a heavy burden\" on us all. However, there are still many questions to answer. The vaccine was given as a nasal spray in the experiments, but may need to be breathed in through a nebuliser to reach the depths of human lungs. It is not known whether the same effect can be achieved in people or how long the immune system would stay in amber alert. There are differences in the immune systems between mice and humans, including our immunity being shaped by decades of infections. So the researchers are planning trials where one person is vaccinated and then deliberately infected to see how their body copes. There may also be consequences to dialling up the immune system beyond its normal state – raising questions of immune disorders. Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the work was undeniably \"exciting\" but cautioned \"we have to ensure that keeping the body on 'high alert' doesn't lead to friendly fire, where a hyper-ready immune system accidentally triggers unwelcome side effects\". The research team in the US does not think the immune system should be permanently dialled up and think such a vaccine should be used to complement rather than replace current vaccines. In the first stages of a pandemic, like early 2020 with Covid, a universal vaccine could buy time and save lives while a specialist vaccine was being developed. \"That would reduce mortality, disease severity, and perhaps build up a level of immune resilience that would have a huge impact,\" says Pulendran. The other scenario is at the start of winter when the usual wide range of winter bugs start to spread, \"one could imagine a seasonal spray that could be administered to imprint broad immunity\" against them all.

    "        \"text\": \"\"\"A hospital ward has been closed and people have been urged to avoid visiting if they have recently had a bug after a rise in norovirus cases. Managers at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds have shut Ward F9 to new admissions and stepped up cleaning regimes across the site to prevent the spread of winter illnesses, including norovirus. They said they had seen more cases of norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, at the hospital. Visitors have been advised not to go to the hospital if they have vomited or had diarrhoea, a high temperature, or a persistent dry cough in the last 48 hours. Patients have been asked to consider whether they could use NHS 111 or visit their GP or pharmacist. However, the hospital added that anyone needing emergency treatment should continue to go there. Staff at the NHS Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board (ICB), which plans and purchases local healthcare services, have also issued advice about the virus as it can rapidly spread. Lisa Nobes, the ICB's nursing director, said: \"Every year there are cases in the community which transfer to the hospital. \"Because the virus has an incubation period of several days, people are often unaware that they are carrying it until after they have passed it on. \"Norovirus is spread by coming into contact with infected people or surfaces. If you have the symptoms of norovirus it is important you stay away from work or school and avoid socialising with others.\" Nobes added the best way for people to avoid catching the virus was to wash their hands properly, especially after using the toilet or handling food.\"\"\"\n",

    "        \"text\": \"\"\"Consuming large amounts of flavonoid-rich foods can help protect against various health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. But eating a diverse range of these foods may offer even greater health benefits than getting flavonoids from a few sources, according to a study published June 2, 2025, by Nature Food. Flavonoids are compounds that give plants their vibrant colors. High-flavonoid foods include tea, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, apples, grapes, plums, red cabbage, red wine, and dark chocolate. For the study, researchers tracked the eating habits of approximately 125,000 people ages 40 to 70 for more than a decade. Those with the highest diversity of flavonoid-rich foods in their diet showed a 20% lower risk of diabetes, a 10% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and an 8% lower risk of cancer compared to people with the lowest diversity. People with the most diverse diets ate about seven different types of flavonoid-rich foods per day. The researchers pointed out that there are more than 6,000 types of flavonoids found in plants. Different ones offer specific benefits. For instance, some are better at improving blood pressure, while others help lower cholesterol or reduce inflammation. Therefore, it makes sense that consuming a range of high-flavonoid foods would provide a broader range of protection. While the study didn’t explore specific amounts, the researchers noted that other studies have shown health benefits associated with consuming at least 500 milligrams of flavonoids per day. This is equal to eating an apple, an orange, and a handful of berries and drinking two cups of tea.\"\"\"\n",

    "        \"title\": \"What is long QT syndrome?\",\n",
    "        \"text\": \"\"\"With every heartbeat, the heart’s muscle cells are busy recharging themselves for the next contraction by moving sodium, potassium, and calcium through tiny pores on their surfaces. In long QT syndrome, these tiny pores don’t work correctly, or an electrolyte imbalance or another condition (such as a heart attack) causes the muscle to take longer than normal to recharge between beats. The resulting delay can disrupt the heart’s carefully choreographed timing. Most often a long QT interval does not cause symptoms; the heart compensates and continues to beat normally. But sometimes — perhaps because of physical or emotional stress — the delay pushes the heart into a fast, erratic heartbeat that may cause shortness of breath, fainting, and sometimes sudden death. Acquired long QT syndrome is more common than the congenital form, but the prevalence is difficult to estimate. A 2023 study suggests that women taking antibiotics and antipsychotic medications face the highest risk. But hundreds of commonly prescribed medications can cause long QT syndrome, including some of those used to treat heart disease, diabetes, depression, and allergies. CredibleMeds, a nonprofit organization funded in part by the FDA, provides a complete, updated list (registration is free for noncommercial entities). People who have inherited genetic variants associated with long QT are more likely to develop a drug-induced form of the syndrome. For people with drug-induced long QT syndrome, the QT delay usually disappears once the drug is stopped. At least one in 2,000 (possibly more) babies are born with congenital long QT syndrome each year. Although researchers have identified several different genes linked to long QT syndrome, mutations in just three of these genes account for up to 90% of inherited cases. Many people who have inherited long QT syndrome do not have any signs or symptoms and only find out they have the condition because of an ECG done for an unrelated reason. A close review of a person’s medical and family history can help uncover the diagnosis. It’s more likely among people with a history of recurring, unexplained fainting or near-fainting that occurs in response to vigorous exercise or a sudden loud noise. An exercise stress test, which involves further ECG testing, or wearing a portable ECG monitor can also be helpful to confirm the diagnosis.\"\"\"\n",

    "        \"text\": \"\"\"A new study provides hope that smarter timing of cancer treatments could improve cure rates. The study's Principal Investigator, Dr Robert Noble, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics, City, St George's, University of London, sought to tackle a major problem in cancer care. Although tumors may at first shrink under therapy, in many cases they eventually regrow. These relapses stem from a small number of cancer cells that have gained mutations making the cells resistant to the treatment.\" Dr. Robert Noble, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics, City, St George's, University of London The standard clinical approach is to wait and see if a tumor regrows before trying a different treatment. By this point, some tumor cells are likely to have gained mutations making them resistant to the second treatment, which then also fails. Evolutionary theory suggests an alternative strategy. Instead of waiting, it might be better to switch to a second treatment while the tumor is still responding to the first one. This \"kick it while it's down\" approach is most appropriate when doctors know from experience that even the best option for a first treatment often fails due to resistance.

Download the latest edition As Dr Noble explains in a podcast about the study, \"Evolutionary approaches have been very successful in other contexts, such as combatting antibiotic resistance, or predicting what vaccines we should use in a particular flu season. There is every reason to suppose that similar approaches should work in tumors.\" To test this hypothesis, Dr Noble and colleagues adapted mathematical methods more commonly used to understand how plants and animals evolve in response to environmental pressures, such as climate change. In their study, the team concludes that their findings justify further experimental and clinical testing of this innovative evolutionary treatment strategy. Three small clinical trials are already underway in soft-tissue cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. Further trials are in development. \"Our models predict that this new approach will generally outperform the standard of care,\" explains Dr Noble. \"A sequence of two treatments, even if optimally timed, is likely to succeed only in relatively small tumors. But we have reason to hope that switching between three or more treatments, following the same principle, could eliminate larger tumors.\"\"\"\n",

Early animal trials suggest a three-month duration of effectiveness, with additional benefits against allergens. The research, though in early stages, has garnered excitement for its potential to revolutionize respiratory infection protection.

Women on antibiotics and antipsychotics are at higher risk. Genetic factors play a significant role, with three genes accounting for most inherited cases.

This delay can disrupt the heart's normal rhythm, causing arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and sudden cardiac death. Acquired LQTS is more common than congenital LQTS, but its prevalence is unknown. Women taking certain medications, such as antipsychotics and antibiotics, appear to be at an increased risk. People with inherited LQTS have mutations in three genes, KCNQ3, SCN5A, and SCN4B, which encode proteins that function in the heart's electrical system. Inherited LQTS is usually diagnosed during childhood, but it can remain und</td>\n",

Dr Robert Noble, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics, City, St George's, University of London, sought to tackle a major problem in cancer care. Dr Noble adapted mathematical methods more commonly used to understand how plants and animals evolve in response to environmental pressures, such as climate change, to predict how cancer cells might respond to evolutionary treatment strategies. Three small clinical trials are already underway in soft-tissue cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. Further trials are in development. The study concludes that this innovative evolutionary treatment strategy generally outperforms the standard of care.</td>\n",

They said they had seen more cases of norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, at the hospital. Visitors have been advised not to go to the hosp...   \n",
       "7   Eating a diverse range of flavonoid-rich foods, such as tea, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, apples, grapes, plums, red cabbage, red wine, and dark chocolate, may offer greater health benefits than getting flavonoids from a few sources. Foods rich in flavonoids include tea, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, apples, grapes, plums, red cabbage, red wine, and dark chocolate. For the study, researchers tracked the eating habits of approximately 125,000 people ages 40 to 70 for more than a ...   \n",
       "8   Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a heart rhythm disorder that affects the electrical system of the heart. The electrical system coordinates the heart's contractions, ensuring that each heartbeat is synchronized with the next. Long QT syndrome occurs when the heart's electrical system takes longer than normal to recharge between heartbeats, resulting in an abnormally long pause (QT interval) on an electrocardiogram (ECG). This delay can disrupt the heart's normal rhythm, causing arrhythmias (irregu...   \n",

Dr Robert Noble, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics, City, St George's, University of London, sought to tackle a major problem in cancer care.

The vaccine works by mimicking immune cell communication, keeping macrophages on high alert in the lungs, potentially reducing viral and bacterial penetration by up to 1,000-fold. Early animal trials suggest a three-month duration of effectiveness, with additional benefits against allergens. The research, though in early stages, has garnered excitement for its potential to revolutionize respiratory infection protection.

    "- **Approach:** Implemented HEAL-Summ-lite using three locally deployable LLMs (Phi‑3.5 Mini, Apple OpenELM‑3B, FLAN‑T5‑Large) to generate health text summaries of 120-180 words.  \n",
    "- **Assumptions:** Summaries should retain key numerical data and named entities; light heuristics suffice for initial safety checks; small dataset representative for demonstration.  \n",
    "- **What worked:** Readability computation and risk heuristics flagged relevant issues; table and visualizations clearly presented model differences; Apple OpenELM‑3B consistently met length requirements.  \n",
    "- **What didn’t work / failure case:** FLAN‑T5 systematically produced summaries below 120 words (avg 60-79); some summaries still omitted numerical details or named entities despite heuristics.  \n",
    "- **Evaluation/check:** Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) computed per summary; human review triggered for readability <50 or any risk flags.  \n",
    "- **Human review rule:** Escalates summaries if readability <50, any risk flag is raised, or summary length is outside 120-180 words (via length flags).  \n",
    "- **Improvements next:** Add named entity recognition (NER) for better accuracy; expand risk heuristics to check factual correctness; test on larger datasets; consider human-in-the-loop validation.  \n",
    "- **Advanced metrics:** Lexical diversity (Distinct‑1/2) calculated to detect redundancy and measure richness of vocabulary."

    "- **Apple OpenELM-3B:** Most readable (avg FRE 46) - accessible to high school readers.  \n",
    "- **FLAN-T5-Large:** Moderate readability (avg FRE 45), but all summaries fell below 120 words.  \n",
    "- **Phi-3.5 Mini:** Least readable (avg FRE 22), with dense medical terminology.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk Flags\n",
    "- **Apple OpenELM-3B:** Conservative (1/5 texts flagged) - only the cancer summary for missing numbers.  \n",
    "- **Phi-3.5 Mini:** Moderate (3/5 flagged) - issues with missing numbers, named entities, and potential overconfident.  \n",
    "- **FLAN-T5-Large:** Most sensitive (5/5 flagged) - dominated by “Too short” warnings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Length Compliance (120-180 words)\n",
    "- **Apple OpenELM-3B:** Best adherence; summaries mostly within range.  \n",
    "- **Phi-3.5 Mini:** Mixed - some too short (e.g., norovirus: 97 words).  \n",
    "- **FLAN-T5-Large:** All summaries too short (avg 60-79 words).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lexical Diversity (Distinct‑1)\n",
    "- **FLAN-T5-Large & Phi-3.5 Mini:** High diversity (~0.78, ~0.77).  \n",
    "- **Apple OpenELM-3B:** Lower diversity (~0.69) but more complete summaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Human Review\n",
    "- 12/15 summaries flagged  \n",
    "- Frequent triggers:  \n",
    "  - Insufficient length (8×)\n",
    "  - Missing numbers (7×)\n",
    "  - Missing named entities (2×)\n",
    "  - Potential overconfident medical claim (2×)\n",

    "- **Apple:** Complete, readable, conservative flags.  \n",
    "- **Phi:** Detailed but complex, moderate flags.  \n",
    "- **FLAN-T5:** Simple but incomplete, over‑flags."
