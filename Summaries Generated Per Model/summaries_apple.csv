BBC,"Single vaccine could protect against all coughs, colds and flus, researchers say",Apple OpenELM-3B,"A single nasal spray vaccine could protect against all coughs, colds and flus, as well as bacterial lung infections, and may even ease allergies, say US researchers. The team at Stanford University have tested their ""universal vaccine"" in animals and still need to do human clinical trials. Their approach marks a ""radical departure"" from the way vaccines have been designed for more than 200 years, they say. Experts in the field said the study was ""really exciting"" despite being at an early stage and could be a ""major step forward"". Current vaccines train the body to fight one single infection. A measles vaccine protects against only measles and a chickenpox vaccine protects against only chickenpox. This is how immunisation has worked since Edward Jenner pioneered vaccines in the late 18th Century. The approach described in the journal Science does not train the immune system. Instead it mimics the way immune cells communicate with each other. It is given as a nasal spray and leaves white blood cells",57.67,None,No
BBC,Hospital warns visitors about rising norovirus cases,Apple OpenELM-3B,"A hospital ward has been closed and people have been urged to avoid visiting if they have recently had a bug after a rise in norovirus cases. Managers at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds have shut Ward F9 to new admissions and stepped up cleaning regimes across the site to prevent the spread of winter illnesses, including norovirus. They said they had seen more cases of norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, at the hospital. Visitors have been advised not to go to the hospital if they have vomited or had diarrhoea, a high temperature, or a persistent dry cough in the last 48 hours. Patients have been asked to consider whether they could use NHS 111 or visit their GP or pharmacist. However, the hospital added that anyone needing emergency treatment should continue to go there. Staff at the NHS Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board (ICB), which plans and purchases local healthcare services, have also issued advice about the virus as it can rapidly spread.

Harvard Health,Eating diverse flavonoid foods may provide extra health protection,Apple OpenELM-3B,"Eating a diverse range of flavonoid-rich foods, such as tea, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, apples, grapes, plums, red cabbage, red wine, and dark chocolate, may offer greater health benefits than getting flavonoids from a few sources. Foods rich in flavonoids include tea, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, apples, grapes, plums, red cabbage, red wine, and dark chocolate. For the study, researchers tracked the eating habits of approximately 125,000 people ages 40 to 70 for more than a decade. People with the highest diversity of flavonoid-rich foods in their diet showed a 20% lower risk of diabetes, a 10% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and an 8% lower risk of cancer compared to people with the lowest diversity. People with the most diverse diets ate about seven different types of flavonoid-rich foods per day. The researchers noted that there are more than",53.52,None,No
Harvard Health,What is long QT syndrome?,Apple OpenELM-3B,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a heart rhythm disorder that affects the electrical system of the heart. The electrical system coordinates the heart's contractions, ensuring that each heartbeat is synchronized with the next. Long QT syndrome occurs when the heart's electrical system takes longer than normal to recharge between heartbeats, resulting in an abnormally long pause (QT interval) on an electrocardiogram (ECG). This delay can disrupt the heart's normal rhythm, causing arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and sudden cardiac death. Acquired LQTS is more common than congenital LQTS, but its prevalence is unknown. Women taking certain medications, such as antipsychotics and antibiotics, appear to be at an increased risk. People with inherited LQTS have mutations in three genes, KCNQ3, SCN5A, and SCN4B, which encode proteins that function in the heart's electrical system. Inherited LQTS is usually diagnosed during childhood, but it can remain und",36.9,None,Yes
News-Medical,"Smarter timing of cancer treatments could improve cure rates, study suggests",Apple OpenELM-3B,"The study provides hope that smarter timing of cancer treatments could improve cure rates. Dr Robert Noble, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics, City, St George's, University of London, sought to tackle a major problem in cancer care. Dr Noble adapted mathematical methods more commonly used to understand how plants and animals evolve in response to environmental pressures, such as climate change, to predict how cancer cells might respond to evolutionary treatment strategies. Three small clinical trials are already underway in soft-tissue cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. Further trials are in development. The study concludes that this innovative evolutionary treatment strategy generally outperforms the standard of care.",27.73,"Missing numbers, Too short (<120 words)",Yes
